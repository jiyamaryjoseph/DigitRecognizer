# Tensorflow-Tensorboard
Here I am discribing introduction of tensorboard.
## TensorBoard: TensorFlow's visualization toolkit.


- TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation.

- Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy.

- Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers).

- Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time.

- Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space.

- Displaying images, text, and audio data.

- Profiling TensorFlow programs.

- And much more.
